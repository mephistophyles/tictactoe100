I was stuck in a train with my laptop, and decided to make a quick CLI version of tictactoe where you don't take turns playing, but each round you auction off the move to the highest bidder in a hidden auction.
There are several variations to the game:

 * The winning bid amount is subtracted from the winning bidder's account, loser doesn't lose his bid
 * Both bids are subtracted from the respected bidder's account
 * The winning bid is paid out to the loser
 
Each variation introduces new considerations to the game and affects strategy accordingly.
